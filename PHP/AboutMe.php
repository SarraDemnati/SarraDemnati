              <h1>Who am I?</h1>
              <p>Hi, my name is Robin Schellingerhout. I am a 19-year-old enthusiastic game developer from Nieuw-Vennep. I currently study game development at Mediacollege, Amsterdam. During this study, I learn to work with a variate of programming languages for broader knowledge. On the working floor, I'm a profound team player that can also work individually.</p>

              <h1>Hobbies</h1>
              <p>Of course, I love gaming preferably multiplayer-games. Also, I like to photograph nature. And I like going to the gym. Shortly when I have money, I want to start airsoft as well. I am really looking forward to this.</p>

              <h1>Why game development?</h1>
              <p>I am a creative person and I admire seeing people enjoy my work. This is what makes me happy. I think gaming is a precious way of escaping reality and can relate myself to this. I grant satisfaction in writing 'flawless' code and strive to perfection. One of my ultimate goals is leaving something behind, something of me, something I can look back on and be proud of myself.</p>
